- I used npx create-react-app to get the skeleton of the files and then removed any unnecessary files.
- The name, tagline and image have been used for the cards which made use of the react bootstrap library I mentioned earlier.
- I've used Axios for the API Call

- npm i should install all packages needed to view the project

Thanks for the opportunity!
